## inspect our new variable 
siteyear_summary             

## make a table with our new variable
siteyear_summary %>%
  kable()

## practice exercise // use median
lobsters %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarize(median_size_mm = median(size_mm, na.rm=TRUE))


## solution:

siteyear_summary <- lobsters %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_siteyear =  n(), 
            mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 
            sd_size_mm = sd(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 
            median_size_mm = median(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE))


siteyear_summary


## a ggplot option:
ggplot(data = siteyear_summary, aes(x = year, y = median_size_mm, color = site)) +
  geom_line() 

ggsave(here("figures", "lobsters-line.png"))

## another option:
ggplot(siteyear_summary, aes(x = year, y = median_size_mm)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~site)

ggsave(here("figures", "lobsters-col.png"))

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```

  
  
"There are `r nrow(lobsters)` total lobsters included in this report.‚Äù   
  
```

## Including Plots



You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
