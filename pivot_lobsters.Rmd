## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```
## attach libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here)
library(skimr) # install.packages('skimr')
library(kableExtra) # install.packages('kableExtra')

## read in data
lobsters <- read_xlsx(here("data/lobsters.xlsx"), skip=4)

# summary, but not effective with character data
summary(lobsters)


lobsters %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_year = n())
  
# what if you don't use group_by?
lobsters %>%
  summarize(count =  n())  

#what if you only use group_by?
lobsters %>%
  group_by(year)
  
  
lobsters  

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
